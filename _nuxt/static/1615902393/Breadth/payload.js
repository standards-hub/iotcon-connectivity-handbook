Lower intensity use cases typically handle millions of devices that are all connected and sending relatively infrequent data. In general, relatively modest amounts of data accumulate in these systems, and messages (often less than 1KB) are sent at relatively infrequent intervals. For example, a smart temperature meter doesn’t need to publish the current temperature every second because it remains constant over such a short timeframe. Similarly, in car fleet management, it is not required to send data such as position or average speed every minute because the use case does not need it. This would be a waste of resources such as power, computing capacity, or data storage. Manufacturing, however, can be much larger in scale and scope."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Industrial IoT devices have critical real-time needs for repeatability and high availability.
