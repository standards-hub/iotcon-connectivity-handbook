Platforms are open for extension but closed for modification, thus providing scalability while minimizing breakage. They favor standard features and functionality over specifics tuned to one line or site. With stable, open, and well-documented APIs (Application Program Interface), provide a framework in which clients can implement their extensions with confidence and ensure interoperability. Additionally, security reviews of the core services can be centrally managed, and policies can be applied one-time, at platform design and deployment.

Traditionally, experts possessing intimate, proprietary knowledge of their particular machines, production cells, and assembly lines performed this optimization. In this people-centric analog environment, cross-domain orchestration and optimization is complex and typically does not scale to other production sites. With the connection of OT assets and the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities from the cloud, data can be used from one site to train ML models, and additional sites can take advantage of the resulting learnings. As new sites are connected and leveraged through algorithms and ML models, new data from those locations enhance the data set. Feedback communication is sent from the cloud-based models back down to the shop floor to implement changes based on these learnings. As ML models become trained and their results gain reliability, insights from the cloud trigger actions on the shop floor. Closed feedback loops generate virtuous cycles of learning, adapting, and efficiencies."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:l,props:{id:z},children:[{type:b,tag:f,props:{ariaHidden:g,href:"#35-consistent-device-management",tabIndex:h},children:[{type:b,tag:i,props:{className:[j,k]},children:[]}]},{type:a,value:A}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"A uniform approach to device management over the entire life cycle is required to ensure efficient administration of the many devices on the shop floor.
